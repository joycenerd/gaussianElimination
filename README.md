#  Gaussian Elimination Program

## Introduction ##

This C++ program can do gaussian elimination. You can enter the coefficient matrix, and the constant in the right side of the equal sign, this program will calculate the unknown numbers. It's solving Ax=b and it's determinant.

## Procedure ##

### Step 1 ###

Enter how many are the unknown numbers

### Step 2 ###

Enter the coefficient matrix which form the functions of polynomials (A)

### Step 3 ###

Enter b

### Step 4 ###

if there is no an unique solution then the determinant will be 0 and there will be no solution print on the screen, but if there is an unique solution then there will be a determinant not 0 and the solutions (x)
